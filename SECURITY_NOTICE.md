# üîí Security Notice - Documentation Cleanup Required

**IMPORTANT:** Before pushing to public repository, the following files contain real API keys and credentials that were added during development. These are now marked for removal or sanitization.

## Files With Exposed Credentials

### ‚ùå TO BE DELETED (Contains Real Keys)
These files were created during development and should be removed before public push:

1. **`API_KEYS_STATUS.md`** - Contains real MongoDB URI and API keys
2. **`DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`** - Contains real credentials in examples
3. **`PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`** - May contain sensitive info

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TO BE SANITIZED (Contains Examples with Real Keys)
These files should be reviewed and real keys replaced with placeholders:

1. **`FINAL_STATUS.md`** - Line 114, 124: Partial real keys
2. **`COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Check for any exposed credentials
3. **`FINAL_PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Check for any exposed credentials

## ‚úÖ Already Secured

- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Properly configured to ignore `.env` files
- ‚úÖ `backend/.env.example` - Real keys replaced with placeholders
- ‚úÖ `frontend/.env.example` - Real keys replaced with placeholders
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` (root) - Real credentials removed

## üö® Action Required Before Public Push

```bash
# Option 1: Delete development documentation files
rm API_KEYS_STATUS.md
rm DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
rm PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md

# Option 2: Create a clean documentation set
# Keep only: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE
```

## üîê Security Checklist

- [x] `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` files sanitized
- [ ] Documentation files cleaned
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] No private keys committed
- [ ] No real database credentials
- [ ] No real API keys

## üìù Recommended Actions

1. **Delete or sanitize documentation files** listed above
2. **Search for any remaining real keys** in all markdown files
3. **Verify no `.env` files** are tracked by git
4. **Generate new API keys** after going public (rotate all keys)
5. **Update MongoDB IP whitelist** if needed

## üéØ Safe to Keep

These files are safe for public repository:
- README.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- SECURITY.md
- LICENSE
- CHANGELOG.md
- All code files (verified no hardcoded secrets)
